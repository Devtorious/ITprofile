I am a vietnamese who is currently a first year IT student of RMIT University which is an International University. I choose IT mainly because I am bad at speaking with more than three people, not an anti-social just socially akwarded. I am very bad at opening a conversation and durring conversations i've heard from people that it usually seems like i try to avoid people but in fact i am not. With this personallity i also picked up some hobby that's pretty suited for a shut-in like me, which is building model kits and collecting things that i like along side with items that related to computers just because i'm currious about how certain thing work. Although I can speak Vietnamese and English fairly decent but I am also self studdying Japanese due to the fact that I wanted to communicate better with some of my friends.</p>
<h2>Interested in IT</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To be honest I am only moderately interested in IT compare to most of the other subjects that I usually find</li>
