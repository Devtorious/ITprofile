I am a vietnamese who is currently a first year IT student of RMIT University which is an International University. I choose IT mainly because I am bad at speaking with more than three people, not an anti-social just socially akwarded. I am very bad at opening a conversation and durring conversations i've heard from people that it usually seems like i try to avoid people but in fact i am not. With this personallity i also picked up some hobby that's pretty suited for a shut-in like me, which is building model kits and collecting things that i like along side with items that related to computers just because i'm currious about how certain thing work. Although I can speak Vietnamese and English fairly decent but I am also self studying Japanese due to the fact that I wanted to communicate better with some of my friends.</p>
<h2>Interested in IT</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To be honest I am only moderately interested in IT compare to most of the other subjects that I found.</li>
    <li>There are way too many things in IT that is interesting, I'm not so sure abou what is my actual interest in it because there are quite alot of option to pick from. Also I'm just highly currious about certain things work, how can I change it to my preference and I genuinly like to do "reverse engineering" from time to time to see how is a certain program or hardware funtioning.</li>
    <li>I was eligible to become a student of an engineering school but due to ease of transportation and location RMIT is the only left for my parent to pick out for me?</li>
    <li>I expect many things in studying in this field in the past but over the year I've learnt to lower my expectation so I could look at a certain thing in this subject in more details and how I can approach deeper in the IT field.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why I picked these jobs</h2>
I wanted to pick these job because with my experience as a part-time product and software tester and game tester in the past for 3 years, I think I could get the hang of the environment pretty easily and be able to adapt to what I will have to cope with in the future. People may find that I rarely communicate verbally with people nor very well that I wasn't able to even able to do testing and report work with other people but I manage very well through out my time there and I was able to find errors that some people wasn't even expected.
